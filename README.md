Written by Aslı Gizem Çınar

This code finds the best sequence that can most closely create the given experimental spectrum(experimental_spec)
(which is a mass spectrometry outcome of an unknown cyclopeptide.) by using branch and bound algorithm.
The branching step adds every amino acid to a peptide.(function starts with an empty peptide.)
(accepts the aas with same mass as one. I and L, K and Q)
Bounding step trims the outcome of the branching step with respect to N.

    TEH PSEUDOCODE OF THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION
LeaderboardCyclopeptideSequencing(Spectrum, N)
        Leaderboard ← set containing only the empty peptide
        LeaderPeptide ← empty peptide
        while Leaderboard is non-empty
            Leaderboard ← Expand(Leaderboard)(with every aa)
                for each Peptide in Leaderboard
                    if Mass(Peptide) = ParentMass(Spectrum)
                        if Score(Peptide, Spectrum) > Score(LeaderPeptide, Spectrum)
                            LeaderPeptide ← Peptide
                    else if Mass(Peptide) < ParentMass(Spectrum)
                        add Peptide to Candidate peptides
            Leaderboard ← Trim(Candidate peptides, Spectrum, N)
        output LeaderPeptide
